                Demi, of Fresh Focus/Restoration Tees, is wonderful!  She has created business cards, flyers, menus, restaurant logos and more to help my husband with his new business,
                 Lillie J’s Bar-B-Que & Café.  Not only is she professional and prompt, but she’s also courteous and kind.  In addition to assisting my husband with his needs, she created
                 programs for my maternal grandmother’s funeral.  My family and I were so impressed with the program that we literally were in tears when we saw it.
                   The program is a keepsake that we will cherish for years to come.  She is a wiz at creating things and doing anything with a computer.  You can’t go wrong with company!
